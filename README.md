# Research Rover: Academic Research Marketplace

> **Bridge the Gap in Sri Lanka's Research Ecosystem**

Research Rover is a centralized digital platform designed to connect ambitious undergraduate students with researchers and opportunities across Sri Lanka. It solves the critical fragmentation issue in the academic ecosystem by providing a single marketplace for research collaboration.

## 🚀 The Problem & Solution

**The Problem:**
Currently, finding research opportunities in Sri Lankan universities is a fragmented, manual process dependent on notice boards or word-of-mouth. Access is often limited to a student's own immediate department.

**The Solution:**
Research Rover serves as a "LinkedIn for Research," allowing:
-   **Researchers** to post projects and find suitable student assistants.
-   **Students** to browse opportunities across institutions and fields (IT, Biology, Engineering, etc.).

## 🛠 Technology Stack

-   **HTML5:** Semantic structure for accessibility.
-   **CSS3:** Native variables, Flexbox/Grid layouts, and glassmorphism styling.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Single Page Application (SPA) architecture with custom router.
-   **No Frameworks:** Built with pure Vanilla JS for maximum performance and educational value.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **SPA Architecture:** Seamless navigation between Home, Login, and Dashboard views without page reloads.
-   **Role-Based Dashboards:**
    -   *Student Mode:* Track applications and view saved projects.
    -   *Researcher Mode:* Manage posted listings and review applicants.
-   **Live Filtering:** Real-time search and category filtering for research opportunities.
-   **Data Persistence:** Uses `localStorage` to simulate a persistent login session and mock database.
-   **Interactive UI:** Includes detailed modals, toast notifications, and smooth transitions.

## 📦 Setup & Usage

Since this is a client-side prototype, no backend server is required.

1.  **Clone or Download** the repository.
2.  **Open `index.html`** in any modern web browser.
3.  **Explore:**
    -   Use the **Login** button (top right) to enter the simulation.
    -   **Student Login:** Use any email (e.g., `student@cmb.ac.lk`) to see the Student Dashboard.
    -   **Researcher Login:** Select the "Researcher" tab and login to see the Researcher Dashboard.
